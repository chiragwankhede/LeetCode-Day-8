🌟 Day 8: Tackling LeetCode Problems 🚀

Hello everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share the progress I made on Day 8 of my 50-day LeetCode milestone challenge. Today, I solved a couple of interesting problems that further sharpened my understanding of array manipulation and sliding window techniques. Below are the details of what I tackled on Day 8.

Contents:
1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Q26)
    - Approach: Utilized two pointers to efficiently remove duplicates in-place.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳

2. Maximum Average Subarray (Q643)
    - Approach: Implemented a sliding window technique to identify the subarray with the highest average.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳

Why This Matters:
Understanding and implementing these foundational techniques, such as two pointers and sliding windows, are crucial for solving complex array-related problems. These techniques are widely applicable in both competitive programming and technical interviews.

Repository Structure:
- `remove_duplicates_sorted_array.cpp`: Contains the code for removing duplicates from a sorted array using the two-pointer technique.
- `maximum_average_subarray.cpp`: Contains the code for finding the subarray with the maximum average using a sliding window approach.
- `README.md`: This readme file explaining the purpose and usage of the code files.

 How to Use:
- Explore the code examples in the respective files to understand the approaches used to solve these problems.
- Use these examples as a reference for your own projects and studies.
